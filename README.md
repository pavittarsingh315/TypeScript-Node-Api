# TypeScript Node Api

## First Commit

1. Installed all dependencies and devDependencies. There are a lot.
2. Set up TSConfig.json
3. Layed out folder structure for app.
4. Initialized app in server.ts

## Second Commit

1. Connected to mongoDB and set up a custom logger cause console.log is inefficient.
2. Created a route handle function which has a register and healthcheck route.
3. Created a really weird flow for the register route. Its kinda complicated but honestly a lot more maintainable. Definetly still play around with it though.
4. Run "tsc" in the terminal and it'll create a dist folder with the js version of the app.
